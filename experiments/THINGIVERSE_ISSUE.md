# Thingiverse Connection Issue

**Status**: ❌ Not Working  
**Error**: MCP error -32000: Connection closed  
**Package**: `@gpaul-mcp/MCP_thingiverse`

---

## Problem

The Thingiverse MCP server keeps failing to connect with "Connection closed" errors. This indicates the npm package either:
1. Doesn't exist or was removed
2. Has incompatible MCP protocol version
3. Requires different configuration

## Error Logs

```
Failed to connect to server thingiverse: MCP error -32000: Connection closed
```

Repeats continuously with retry attempts.

## What I Did

1. **Disabled Thingiverse server** in `config/mcp-servers.json`
2. **Documented issue** for future investigation
3. **Hub still works great** with other 4 servers

## Current Server Status

**✅ WORKING (75 tools)**:
- Obsidian: 18 tools
- Blender: 17 tools
- GitHub: 26 tools
- Godot: 14 tools

**❌ NOT WORKING**:
- Thingiverse: 0 tools

## Alternatives

### Option 1: Find Different Package

Search npm for other Thingiverse MCP servers:
```bash
npm search mcp thingiverse
```

### Option 2: Build Your Own

Use the `mcp-builder` skill to create a Thingiverse server:
1. Read Thingiverse API docs
2. Create MCP server with Python or TypeScript
3. Integrate with hub

### Option 3: Use Web Scraper

Enable the web-scraper MCP server:
- Can scrape Thingiverse website
- Less elegant but functional

### Option 4: Skip It

You have 75 tools from 4 solid servers - more than enough for game development!

## Future Investigation

When time permits:
1. Test package standalone: `npx -y @gpaul-mcp/MCP_thingiverse`
2. Check package exists: Visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gpaul-mcp/MCP_thingiverse
3. Look for alternatives
4. Consider creating custom server

## Recommendation

**For now: Disable and move on**

You have:
- ✅ Knowledge management (Obsidian)
- ✅ 3D modeling (Blender)
- ✅ Version control (GitHub)
- ✅ Game engine (Godot)

That's a powerful gamedev toolset! Thingiverse can wait.

**I've disabled it in the config so it stops trying to connect.**
