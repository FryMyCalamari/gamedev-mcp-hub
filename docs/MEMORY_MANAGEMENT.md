# Memory Management & Performance

## Overview

The GameDev MCP Hub is designed to run continuously without memory leaks or performance degradation. This document explains the memory management strategies in place.

---

## 🔧 Automatic Cleanup Mechanisms

### 1. Client Connection Cleanup

**Location**: `src/index-sse.ts`

**What it does**:
- Tracks connected AI clients in a Map
- Automatically removes stale entries every 5 minutes
- Disconnected clients are removed immediately via `req.on('close')`
- Stale clients (idle > 1 hour) are cleaned up periodically

**Memory Impact**: Prevents Map from growing indefinitely

```typescript
// Runs every 5 minutes
cleanupStaleClients() {
  // Remove clients idle > 1 hour
  // Clears disconnected entries
}
```

### 2. WebSocket Cleanup

**Location**: `src/gui/websocket-handler.ts`

**What it does**:
- Maintains Set of connected WebSocket clients
- Removes clients on disconnect via `ws.on('close')`
- Clears all clients on server shutdown
- Stops periodic update intervals on shutdown

**Memory Impact**: No dangling WebSocket connections

```typescript
stop() {
  clearInterval(this.updateInterval);  // Stop timers
  this.clients.clear();                 // Clear Set
}
```

### 3. Server Connection Cleanup

**Location**: `src/server/connection-manager.ts`

**What it does**:
- Closes downstream MCP server connections properly
- Clears Maps on disconnect: `connections`, `clients`
- Handles reconnection timeouts properly
- Cleanup on circuit breaker opens

**Memory Impact**: No zombie server connections

```typescript
disconnectAll() {
  // Close all client connections
  // Clear connection Maps
  // Stop all reconnection timers
}
```

### 4. Interval Cleanup

**All intervals are cleared on shutdown**:

| Location | Interval | Purpose | Cleanup |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `index-sse.ts` | 5 min | Client cleanup | ✅ Cleared |
| `hub-server.ts` | N/A | Analytics | ✅ Cleared |
| `websocket-handler.ts` | 2 sec | Status updates | ✅ Cleared |
| `gui/app.js` | 5 sec | Client refresh | ✅ Cleared |

## 💾 Memory Usage Expectations

### Normal Operation

**Baseline** (no clients):
- Node.js runtime: ~50-100 MB
- Hub code: ~20-30 MB
- Loaded modules: ~30-50 MB
- **Total**: ~100-180 MB

**With 4 servers connected**:
- Each MCP server process: ~50-150 MB
- Hub tracking overhead: ~10 MB per server
- **Added**: ~40-60 MB in hub

**With 5 AI clients connected**:
- Client tracking: ~1-2 MB per client
- **Added**: ~5-10 MB

**Total Expected** (4 servers + 5 clients):
- Hub process: ~150-250 MB
- Downstream servers (separate processes): ~200-600 MB total
- **System Total**: ~350-850 MB

### Over Time (24 hours)

**Expected behavior**:
- Memory usage should remain **stable**
- Periodic cleanup prevents unbounded growth
- Maps and Sets are cleared properly
- No memory leaks detected in testing

**Warning signs**:
- Memory growing continuously over hours
- Not returning to baseline after client disconnect
- Degraded performance after extended use

## 🔍 Monitoring Memory

### Check Hub Memory Usage

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
# Find Node.js processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "node"} | Select-Object Name, Id, WS, PM

# Continuous monitoring
while ($true) {
  Get-Process node | Select-Object Id, WS -First 1
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
}
```

**Windows Task Manager**:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Details tab
3. Find "node.exe" processes
4. Sort by Memory
5. Watch over time

### Check from GUI

**Built-in monitoring** (coming soon):
- SYSTEM tab will show memory usage
- Per-server memory tracking
- Client connection counts
- Heap usage metrics

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Connection Pooling

**Downstream servers**:
- Reuse existing connections when possible
- Don't create new connections per request
- Close connections on errors (circuit breaker)

### 2. Efficient Data Structures

**Maps over Objects**:
- `Map` for client tracking (faster lookup)
- `Set` for WebSocket clients (O(1) operations)
- `Map` for tool registry (efficient search)

### 3. Debouncing & Throttling

**GUI updates**:
- WebSocket updates: Every 2 seconds (not per event)
- Client list refresh: Every 5 seconds
- Analytics: On-demand, not constant polling

### 4. Lazy Loading

**Tools and resources**:
- Tools loaded only from connected servers
- Resources fetched on demand
- No preloading of all possible tools

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### 1. Graceful Shutdown

**On Ctrl+C or SIGTERM**:
```typescript
shutdown() {
  1. Stop all timers (setInterval, setTimeout)
  2. Clear all Maps and Sets
  3. Close WebSocket connections
  4. Close downstream MCP connections
  5. Close HTTP/Express servers
  6. Exit cleanly
}
```

**Result**: No orphaned processes or connections

### 2. Circuit Breaker

**For failing servers**:
- Stop retrying after N failures
- Prevent infinite reconnection loops
- Release resources for failed servers

### 3. Timeout Management

**All operations have timeouts**:
- MCP tool calls: 30 seconds
- Server connections: 30 seconds
- HTTP requests: Default Express timeout
- WebSocket ping/pong: 30 seconds

**Result**: No hanging operations consuming memory

### 4. Error Handling

**Uncaught exceptions**:
```typescript
process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {
  logger.error('Uncaught exception:', error);
  // Cleanup and exit (not infinite memory growth)
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Memory Growing Over Time

**Check**:
1. How many clients are connected? (`/api/clients`)
2. How many servers are connected? (GUI SERVERS tab)
3. Are there reconnection loops? (check logs)
4. Old clients not cleaning up? (restart hub)

**Fix**:
- Restart hub if memory > 500 MB
- Check for failed servers constantly reconnecting
- Ensure clients disconnect properly

### High CPU Usage

**Causes**:
- Too many reconnection attempts
- Expensive tool operations (Blender rendering)
- Downstream server issues
- WebSocket spam

**Fix**:
- Check server status (SERVERS tab)
- Disable problematic servers
- Check downstream server processes
- Increase update intervals

### Slow Performance After Hours

**Likely causes**:
- Log file growing (Winston logs)
- Too many failed connection attempts
- Downstream servers degrading

**Fix**:
- Rotate log files (restart hub)
- Clear logs folder periodically
- Check downstream server health
- Restart problematic servers

---

## 🔄 Recommended Maintenance

### Daily

**No action needed** - hub runs continuously

### Weekly

**Check logs**:
```bash
# Check log file sizes
dir logs\

# If combined.log > 100 MB, consider cleanup:
# (Automatic rotation not yet implemented)
```

### Monthly

**Restart hub** (optional):
- Clears any accumulated state
- Resets all connections
- Fresh start for all servers

**How to restart**:
1. Stop hub (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Close GUI browser tab
3. Re-run `start-gui-with-browser.bat`
4. All servers reconnect automatically

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Typical Response Times

| Operation | Expected | Acceptable | Slow |
|-----------|----------|------------|------|
| List tools | <10ms | <50ms | >100ms |
| Call tool (simple) | <100ms | <500ms | >1s |
| Call tool (complex) | <1s | <5s | >10s |
| Server connection | <1s | <3s | >5s |
| GUI load | <200ms | <1s | >2s |
| WebSocket update | <50ms | <200ms | >500ms |

### Acceptable Ranges

**Client connections**: 1-20 concurrent (tested)  
**Server connections**: 4-10 recommended  
**Tools per server**: 10-50 typical  
**Total tools**: 50-500 manageable  

**Beyond these limits**: Performance may degrade

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Close unused AI clients** - Don't leave 10 tabs open
2. **Disable unused servers** - Only enable what you use
3. **Restart occasionally** - Once a week is fine
4. **Monitor task manager** - Watch for memory spikes
5. **Check logs** - Look for errors or warnings

### For Developers

1. **Always clear intervals** - `clearInterval()` on shutdown
2. **Remove Map entries** - Don't let Maps grow unbounded
3. **Close connections** - Always call `.close()` or `.disconnect()`
4. **Avoid global state** - Use instance variables with cleanup
5. **Test long-running** - Run for hours in dev to catch leaks
