## Why Archived?

These files were created during development sessions to track progress and decisions. They served their purpose but are no longer needed for:
- Starting the hub
- Understanding the current architecture
- Contributing to development
- Using the system

However, they provide valuable historical context about:
- Why certain design decisions were made
- How problems were solved
- The evolution of the system
- Development methodology

```
D:\Power\gamedev-mcp-hub\archive\session-docs\
