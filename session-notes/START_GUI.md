## üîß Troubleshooting

### GUI won't start?
**Check config**: Ensure `config/hub-config.json` has:
```json
{
  "features": {
    "rest_api": true,
    "websocket": true
  }
}
```

### Port already in use?
If port 3100 is occupied, change it in `src/gui/gui-server.ts`:
```typescript
const guiServer = new GuiServer(hubServer, 3100); // Change this number
```

### Can't connect from other devices?
**By design!** The GUI is bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) only for security.

To access from network (NOT RECOMMENDED without security):
1. See production security requirements in `docs/GUI.md`
2. Implement authentication and HTTPS
3. Change bind address in `src/gui/gui-server.ts`

### WebSocket connection failing?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure no firewall blocking localhost connections
3. Try disabling browser extensions
4. Refresh the page

### Logs not showing?
1. Verify logs are being generated (check `logs/hub.log`)
2. Check log level filter (set to "ALL LEVELS")
3. Clear filters and refresh

## üéÆ First Steps

### 1. Check Server Status
- Look at the SERVERS tab
- Note which servers are connected
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting a server

### 2. Monitor Logs
- Switch to LOGS tab
- Watch real-time log entries
- Try different filters (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
- Search for specific terms

### 3. View Analytics
- Go to ANALYTICS tab
- See which servers are being used
- Check error rates
- Review top tools

### 4. Browse Documentation
- Open DOCS tab
- Click on a server name
- View available tools
- Check links to repositories
