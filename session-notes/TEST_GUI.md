# 🧪 GUI Testing Guide

## ✅ GUI is Now Fixed and Ready!

The build issue has been resolved. The public files (HTML, CSS, JS) are now correctly copied during build.

---

## 🚀 Start the GUI Now

### **Method 1: Double-Click (Recommended)**

Just double-click:
```
📁 start-gui-with-browser.bat
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Check if Node.js is installed
2. ✅ Install dependencies if needed
3. ✅ Build the project (copies all files)
4. ✅ Start the hub
5. ✅ Open your browser automatically

---

## 🎯 What to Expect

### In the Terminal:
```
========================================
  GameDev MCP Hub - GUI Launcher
========================================

[INFO] Building project...
📦 Copying GUI public files...
  ✓ Copied app.js
  ✓ Copied favicon.ico
  ✓ Copied index.html
  ✓ Copied styles.css
✓ GUI public files copied successfully!
✓ Build completed successfully!

[INFO] Starting GameDev MCP Hub...
[INFO] GUI will be available at: http://localhost:3100

Opening browser in 5 seconds...

[SUCCESS] Hub is running!
```

### In the Logs:
Look for these key messages:
```
[INFO] Hub initialized with X connected servers
[GUI ] Server running on http://127.0.0.1:3100
[GUI ] WebSocket server initialized
```

### In the Browser:

- ✅ You see the dashboard with "GAMEDEV MCP HUB" header
- ✅ Four tabs: SERVERS, LOGS, ANALYTICS, DOCS
- ✅ Green "CONNECTED" status in top right
- ✅ Server cards showing connection status

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### ✅ Issue 1: Internal Server Error (500)
**Problem**: Public files weren't being copied to `dist/gui/public/`  
**Solution**: Updated `scripts/post-build.js` to copy HTML/CSS/JS files during build

### ✅ Issue 2: Missing favicon.ico (404)
**Problem**: No favicon file  
**Solution**: Added placeholder favicon.ico

### ✅ Issue 3: JavaScript errors
**Problem**: Files not found, causing "s is not defined" errors  
**Solution**: Fixed by ensuring all files are copied correctly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Errors?

1. **Make sure you rebuilt:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Check the dist folder:**
   ```bash
   dir dist\gui\public
   ```
   You should see:
   - app.js
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - favicon.ico

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

4. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   type logs\hub.log
   ```
   Look for any error messages

5. **Verify port is available:**
   - Make sure nothing else is using port 3100
   - Try: `netstat -ano | findstr :3100`

### Common Issues:

**"ENOENT: no such file" error**
→ Run `npm run build` again

**"Port 3100 already in use"**
→ Close any other instances of the hub
→ Or change port in `src/gui/gui-server.ts`

**Browser shows blank page**
→ Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors

**WebSocket shows "DISCONNECTED"**
→ Hub isn't running
→ Start with `npm start`

✅ **No console errors** (browser F12)
